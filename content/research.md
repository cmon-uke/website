      title: Our Research
      text: |-
        Our research combines advanced kinematic, psychophysic, and neuroscience methods, including fMRI, TMS, and high density electromyography (hdEMG), with computational approaches to investigate how information encoded in complex movement patterns is transmitted and communicated. 
        

        On this page we give a brief overview of our main research themes

      title: Information transmission in naturalistic behaviours
      subtitle: |- 

      text: |-
        Traditional cognitive neuroscience often reduces behaviour to simplified responses like button presses. We study how structured movement patterns reflect decision processes, intentions, expectations, and confidence. Leveraging state-of-the-art motion tracking techniques and computational modelling, we quantify _kinematic encoding_--how information about cognitive states is encoded in complex movement patterns--and _kinematic readout_--how this information is extracted by observers. Intersecting encoding and readout, we derive models of how information is transmitted in the context of social interaction.

      title: Neurodevelopment of kinematic coding
      subtitle:  
      text: |-
        The ability to extract and transmit information through movement is shaped by development and can be disrupted in neurological and psychiatric conditions. We investigate how kinematic coding mechanisms emerge over the lifespan and how they are altered in disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. By combining kinematic methods with computational modelling, we aim to dissect the computations underlying encoding and readout alternatives, and to develop predictive models of impaired action planning and prediction.

      title: Communication
      subtitle: 
      text: |-
        Social information exchange can be incidental, where information gleaned from another individual is used to plan your own actions, or ostensive and deliberate, such as when demonstrating an action. Our laboratory investigates the coding mechanisms by which communication modulates information transmission: how individuals intentionally alter their movement kinematics to enhance (or reduce) information readout and how these alterations influence the social transmission of information

      title: Human-machine interactions
      subtitle: 
      text: |-
        As research and technologies in artificial intelligence, robotics, and virtual reality continue to advance, these technologies increasingly mediate our social interactions. Using a range of approaches, we study the behaviour of artificial intelligence systems and their interactions with humans
