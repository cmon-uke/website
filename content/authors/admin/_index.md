Cristina Becchio is a Professor of Neuroscience at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany. She originally studied philosophy before shifting her research focus to cognitive science and neuroscience. Prior to joining Hamburg, she was a Full Professor at the University of Turin and a Senior Scientist at the Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa. Her research explores the relationship between movement and cognition, investigating how mental state information is encoded and read out in movement. In this field, she was awarded an ERC Consolidator grant, followed up by an ERC Proof-of-Concept grant.
