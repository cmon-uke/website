I am a PhD student at La Sapienza University of Rome in Psychology and Cognitive Science, working at ISTC-CNR in Rome with Giovanni Pezzulo and the Conan Lab team. I hold a masterâ€™s degree in Cognitive Neuroscience from La Sapienza, during which I spent three months at the University of Copenhagen for an internship at the CoInAct Lab under Prof. Mark Schram Christensen, gaining experience with TMS, EEG, and EMG techniques.

Currently, I am a visiting researcher at the CMON Lab (UKE-Eppendorf, Hamburg) under Prof. Cristina Becchio, running a study on how environmental uncertainty influences the exploration-exploitation trade-off in neurotypical adults. This will later be extended to children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) at the Gaslini Institute in Genoa.

My PhD research focuses on goal-directed decision-making and planning, investigating how people flexibly adjust behavior based on environmental structure and uncertainty. I explore these processes in foraging and planning tasks with neurotypical individuals and clinical populations.
